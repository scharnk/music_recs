# Music Recommendation System<br>TDI Capstone Project (Spring 2021)<br>

This project will utilize _________ to _________ <br>
<br>
AUDIENCE/DEFINED USER<br>

<br>
GOAL<br>
Use record labels to provide recommended content not otherwise returned by standard techniques. 

Content-based, or collaborative recommendation systems could be improved through adding a variable to represent the inverse of the size of the record label, meaning large labels change the output of the model very little, while smaller record labels are weighted higher. 
<!-- music content similarity or collaborative user pattern analysis. -->
<br>
<br>
MOTIVATION<br>
Record labels create collections of music, curated content which could be harnessed to diversify a recommendation system.
<br>
WHAT<br>

<br>
HOW<br>
Using a public database called ListenBrainz with BigQuery
<!-- [ListenBrainz vs Spotify API] -->
<br>
<br>
**use active voice**<br>
**tell a story**<br>
<br>
<br>
<!-- This project will utilize different databases to highlight naturally occurring events in nature to encourage people to get outside during quarantine. Industry applications include outdoor companies marketing towards these local/regional events, organized social distancing outings, and improving mental health. Event examples include bird migration, flowers blooming, comets, meteor showers, etc. Spatial geographic data provides individuals with fun goals to identify previously unnoticed aspects of the world around us.

According to the CDC, the level of anxiety and/or depression in the US during spring of 2019 was estimated at 11% prevalence [1]. After the start of the CoVID-19 pandemic anxiety/depression estimates increased considerably, reaching a range between 33 - 43% from (Apr 2020 - Feb 2021) [2]. A 2019 Nature paper emphasizes the importance of getting 120min of outdoor time per week for decreasing stress and increasing overall mental health [3]. Additionally, another paper shows that individuals that maintain their level of outside time (pre and post-CoVID) have less overall stress and better mental health compared to others where this time has decreased [4]. Studies suggest that time in nature reduces muscle tension, blood pressure, heart rate, and levels of stress hormones such as cortisol [5].
